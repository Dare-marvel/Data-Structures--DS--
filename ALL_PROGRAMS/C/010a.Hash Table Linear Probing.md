## Explanation
This C code implements a simple hash table data structure using an array and the modulo operator as the hash function. The hash table stores integer keys and supports basic operations such as insertion and printing.

Here is a detailed explanation of the main logic of the code:

1. The code defines a `HashTable` structure that contains an integer array `arr` to store the keys and an integer `size` to store the size of the array.

2. The `getHashfn` function takes in a key and a pointer to a `HashTable` structure, and returns the index in the array where the key should be stored, calculated using the modulo operator.

3. The `Initialize` function takes in a pointer to a `HashTable` structure and initializes all elements of the array to -1, indicating that they are empty.

4. The `PrintTable` function takes in a pointer to a `HashTable` structure and prints out the contents of the hash table in a formatted manner.

5. The `Insertion` function takes in a pointer to a `HashTable` structure, a key, and an index, and inserts the key into the hash table at the specified index. If there is already a key stored at that index (i.e., a collision occurs), the function uses linear probing to find the next available index and inserts the key there.

6. The `main` function allocates memory for a `HashTable` structure, prompts the user to enter the size of the hash table, and initializes it. It then prompts the user to enter the number of elements they want to insert into the hash table, and repeatedly prompts them to enter keys until all elements have been inserted.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how this code works. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of inserting n elements into the hash table is O(n), assuming that there are no collisions. In the worst case, if all keys collide and linear probing is used to resolve collisions, the time complexity could be O(n^2).

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is O(size), where size is the size of the hash table specified by the user.

## Code:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

struct HashTable
{
    int * arr;
    int size;
};

int getHashfn(int key , struct HashTable * h){
    return key % (h->size);
}

void Initialize(struct HashTable * h){
    for (int i = 0; i < h->size; i++)
    {
        h->arr[i]=-1;
    }
}

void PrintTable(struct HashTable * h){
    printf("-------------------\n");
    printf("|  Index  |  Key  |\n");
    printf("-------------------\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < h->size; i++)
    {
        if(h->arr[i]!=-1){
            printf("|   %d     |   %2d  |\n",i,h->arr[i]);
        }
        else{
            printf("|   %d     |  NULL |\n",i);
        }
    }
    printf("-------------------\n");
}

void Insertion(struct HashTable * h, int key,int index){
    if(h->arr[index]==-1){
        h->arr[index]=key;
        PrintTable(h);
        return;
    }
    else{
        printf("Collision occurred at index:%d\n",index);
        index=((index+1)%(h->size));
        Insertion(h,key,index);
    }
}


int main()
{
int size;
struct HashTable * h=(struct HashTable *)malloc(sizeof(struct HashTable));

printf("Enter the size of HashTable\n");
scanf("%d",&size);

h->size=size;
h->arr=(int *)malloc(h->size * sizeof(int));

Initialize(h);

int num_ele=100000;

while(num_ele>h->size){
    printf("Enter the number of elements u want to insert in Hash Table\n");
    scanf("%d",&num_ele);
    if(num_ele>h->size){
        printf("Please enter the number of elements less the size of hash table\n");
    }
}

int ele;
for (int i = 0; i < num_ele; i++) {
            printf("Enter the key\n");
            scanf("%d",&ele);
            int index=getHashfn(ele,h);
            Insertion(h,ele,index);
        }   

return 0;
}
