## Explanation
This code is an implementation of a binary expression tree in C. It takes a prefix expression as input and constructs a binary expression tree from it. Here are the main points of the code:
1. The `tree` struct represents a node in the binary expression tree. Each node has a character data value, references to its left and right child nodes, and a reference to the next node in the stack.
2. The `pop` function removes and returns the top node from the stack.
3. The `push` function adds a given node to the top of the stack.
4. The `creation` function creates a new tree node with the given data value.
5. The `Inorder` function performs an inorder traversal of the binary expression tree and prints out the data values of all nodes in inorder sequence.
6. In the `main` function, the program reads the length and characters of a prefix expression from user input, then constructs a binary expression tree from it using a stack. It iterates through the characters of the prefix expression in reverse order. For each character, if it is an operator, it creates a new tree node with the operator as its data value, pops two nodes from the stack and sets them as left and right children of the new node respectively, then pushes the new node onto the stack. If it is an operand, it creates a new tree node with the operand as its data value and pushes it onto the stack. After all characters have been processed, there will be only one node left on the stack, which is the root of the binary expression tree. Finally, it performs an inorder traversal of the binary expression tree and prints out the result.
    
## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of constructing a binary expression tree from a prefix expression of length n is O(n) since we need to iterate through all n characters of the prefix expression once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the binary expression tree since we need to store n nodes.
