## Explanation
This code defines several functions for manipulating a binary search tree. A binary search tree is a data structure in which each node contains a `data` value, a `left` pointer to the left child node, and a `right` pointer to the right child node. The tree is structured such that the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of all nodes in its left subtree and less than or equal to the values of all nodes in its right subtree.

The main logic of this code can be summarized in the following points:

1. The `node` structure is defined to represent a node in the binary search tree. It contains three members: `left`, `data`, and `right`.
2. The `Preorder` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree as an argument and performs a pre-order traversal of the tree, printing out the data values of each node as it visits them.
3. The `Postorder` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree as an argument and performs a post-order traversal of the tree, printing out the data values of each node as it visits them.
4. The `Inorder` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree as an argument and performs an in-order traversal of the tree, printing out the data values of each node as it visits them.
5. The `Creation` function takes a data value as an argument and creates a new node with that data value. It returns a pointer to the new node.
6. The `Insertion` function takes a data value and a pointer to the root of the tree as arguments and inserts a new node with that data value into the tree in its proper position according to the binary search tree property.
7. The `InorderSuccessor` function takes a pointer to a node in the tree as an argument and returns the data value of its in-order successor.
8. The `Search` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and a data value as arguments and searches for a node with that data value in the tree. It returns 1 if such a node is found and 0 otherwise.
9. The `Deletion` function deletes a node with a given data value from a binary search tree and returns the root of the modified tree

## Time and Space Complexity:
Here is a table showing the time and space complexity for each function in the binary search tree code:

| Function            | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| `Preorder`          | O(n)            | O(h)             |
| `Postorder`         | O(n)            | O(h)             |
| `Inorder`           | O(n)            | O(h)             |
| `Creation`          | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| `Insertion`         | O(h)            | O(h)             |
| `InorderSuccessor`  | O(h)            | O(1)             |
| `Search`            | O(h)            | O(1)             |
| `Deletion`          | O(h)            | O(h)             |

The time complexity of the `Preorder`, `Postorder`, and `Inorder` functions is O(n) because they need to visit all n nodes in the tree to perform their operations.
The time complexity of the `Creation` function is O(1) because it performs a fixed number of operations that do not depend on the size of the input.
The time complexity of the `Insertion`, `InorderSuccessor`, `Search`, and `Deletion` functions is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, because they need to traverse from the root of the tree down to one of its leaves to perform their operations.
The space complexity of the `Preorder`, `Postorder`, and `Inorder` functions is O(h) because they use recursive calls that can go as deep as h levels.
The space complexity of the `Creation`, `InorderSuccessor`, and `Search` functions is O(1) because they use only constant extra space regardless of input size.
The space complexity of the `Insertion` and `Deletion` functions is O(h) because they use recursive calls that can go as deep as h levels.
